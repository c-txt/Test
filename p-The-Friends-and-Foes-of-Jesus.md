# The Friends and Foes of Jesus

The scriptures record that during His time here on earth, the Lord was derisively called a friend (G5384: φίλος: filos) of the tax collectors and sinners. But He himself directly addressed only a few — his disciples (in Luke 12:4) and Lazarus (in John 11:11) — as friends.

## What did it mean to be a friend of the Son of God?

The Lord's recorded thoughts on friendship are found in John 15:12-17. The discourse begins in v12 with a command to His disciples to love one another.

> v12-13: This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you. Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends

He had already spoken about this kind of laying down of life in John 10:11 when he had said "I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep," and was soon to demonstrate what that would cost and look like. And it is in this context that He then laid down His criteria for anyone desiring friendship with Him.

> v14: You are my friends if you do what I command you.

It is amazing that He did not ask them to lay down their lives for Him as a route to His friendship. What He asked was radically different and extremely other-centred. A disciple would become His friend only if he genuinely loved the other disciples to the extent of being willing to lay down his life for them. This command required them to raise their understanding of the love in friendship from mutual affection (grk:φιλέω:fileo) to that of the unconditional, self-sacrificial love (grk: ἀγάπη :agapē) that He himself would exhibit on the cross. 

Just as one cannot be friends with one completely opposed to one's core beliefs, the completely self-less Lord could not be friends with those who only understood and desired absolutely self-centred friendships. It would have been an undoubted privilege for any of the disciples to be called a friend of the wise teacher, the great healer, the amazing worker of amazing miracles. But what must have been their reaction when the disciples heard this startling criteria? For to love another stinking fisherman knowing all his faults and weaknesses, to the extent of laying down one's life for him could not imaginably have offered any benefits at all.

Probably, John understood this best much later, when he wrote in his first epistle to the church:
> If anyone says, “I love God,” and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen cannot love God whom he has not seen. - 1 John 4:20

## Just another friendly word

Most English translations of the scriptures are handicapped in that they use the word friend incorrectly in four places, where the original greek uses another word (grk:ἑταῖρος:hetairos). This word, as Vine's Dicitionary of NT words puts it, is a term of kindly address, rather than a term of endearment. It could more accurately be translated as comrade, fellow, or in modern terms man or bro, as we might say to a passing acquaintance "Hey man, how are you?"

It is quite interesting to note that this word in its vocative noun form occurs in the scriptures, only thrice, and in all three instances the Lord can be seen using this form of address, just before rebuking someone's attitude. Look at the first instance:

>   But he replied to one of them, Friend (Ἑταῖρε), I am doing you no wrong. Did you not agree with me for a denarius? - Matt 20:13

The context of this passage is the parable of the laborers in the vineyard. 
The laborers hired early in the morning were shocked when they saw those hired late in the day receiving the same wages as themselves, and grumbled at the Master's rather extravagant generosity, failing to rejoice with the other laborers. The verse above is what the Master said when He addressed one such grumbler, using the word (grk:ἑταῖρος:hetairos).

The next time the Lord uses this word is in the parable of the wedding feast.

> And he said to him, 'Friend (Ἑταῖρε), how did you get in here without a wedding garment?' And he was speechless. Then the king said to the attendants, 'Bind him hand and foot and cast him into the outer darkness.- Matt 22:12-14

The context here is that of a King who had invited people from off the streets to His Son's wedding feast, but then noticed one who had arrived without a wedding garment. In Jewish wedding customs, the guests were expected to wear the wedding garments provided by the host. Clearly the garments provided by the King would have been magnificient for that glorious occassion, but this guest who came in off the streets insisted on wearing his own filthy clothes. Clearly, this metaphorically speaks of an unsaved one who attempts to enter into the delights of heaven based on his own self-righteousness.

Finally, the last time the Lord uses the word (grk:ἑταῖρος:hetairos) is when He addresses the betrayer Judas.

> And he came up to Jesus at once and said, "Greetings, Rabbi!" And he kissed him. Jesus said to him, "Friend (Ἑταῖρε), do what you came to do." Then they came up and laid hands on Jesus and seized him. - Matt 26:49,50

Judas was one of Jesus' chosen disciples, but turned away from him to betray Him. The reason for the betrayal is not clearly revealed in the scriptures but one plausible reason is that like most of the Jews of the time he had hoped that Jesus as the Messiah would restore the kingdom to Israel. However, the Lord had been making it clear to the disciples that setting up an earthly Kingdom was not His immediate plan and that He was going to Jerusalem to die on the cross. Undoubtedly, Judas was close to Jesus as long as he had hopes of earthly privileges and power. But when those hopes were dashed, he allowed the devil to influence him, betrayed the Lord, and eventually met a tragic end with no hope of salvation.

## So, are we friends or foes?

The classic hymn 'What a Friend we Have in Jesus' is an evergreen favorite in many church gatherings. But friendship with the Son of God has of necessity to be on His terms. Unless we are learning to lay down our lives for others, perhaps we need to ask ourselves if Jesus is really our friend. The above scripture passages are rather instructive. There is much to learn, apply, and practice if we aspire to a genuine friendship with the Lord.

But, it is also instructive to ask ourselves, if the Lord were to return today, what word would he use to address us? Would He call us His friends (G5384: φίλος: filos) or are we merely His fellow-humans and in great peril of rebuke? Are we like the grumbling laborer in the vineyard who was envious of what the Lord was blessing the other laborers with? Are we still blissfully clothed in our own self-righteousness like the foolish wedding guest and well on our way to be rudely awakened on a coming day? Or even worse, are we, tragically like Judas, keeping company with the Lord only in the hope of earthly blessings?

These are sobering questions, and ones we would do well to consider.
