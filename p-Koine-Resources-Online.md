## Online Koine Resources

Here are some helpful online koine resources if you're on the road to learning Koine greek: 

### Online Greek Bibles and Lexicons

* [Simple, online greek new testament reader](https://gntreader.com/){:target="_blank"} : A simple easy-to-use online reader version of the greek new testament. It is also keyed to the Abbott Smith Lexicon for quick reference.
* [LaParola Lexicons](https://www.laparola.net/greco/index.php){:target="_blank"} : If you scroll down a bit on this page and click on "Search by Louw-Nida category or English gloss" you can find the relevant entries in various Lexicons all on one page; Strong's, Thayer's, and Luow Nida
* [Greekdoc Parsings](https://greekdoc.github.io/){:target="_blank"} : This is one of the best sites I've found for finding out all the principle parts for verb parsings. Select a NT and then click on any verb, it gives you loads of useful information on the related nouns, adjectives, and verbals forms. And invaluable resource.
* [Customizable online Reader](https://biblewebapp.com/reader/){:target="_blank"} : This site enables you to create a customized greek NT reader version. Unfortunately, it doesn't have an option to print out what you have created.
* [Perseus's Morpheus (Greek Word Study Tool)](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?lang=greek){:target="_blank"}: Type in a greek word using an english keyboard and get its parsings, forms, lexicon entries etc. Very useful.
* [Dr. Shirley Robinson's Online Greek Textbook](http://greek.theopedia.com){:target="_blank"}

### Online Support

* [http://www.ibiblio.org/bgreek/forum/](http://www.ibiblio.org/bgreek/forum/){:target="_blank"} : This is a fantastic community of beginner and extremely experienced koine greek scholars who are helpful and willing to provide support and encouragement and doubts resolution for beginners

### Printables

* [A PDF version of The Greek New Testament
  For Beginning Readers](https://byzantinetext.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/RP2016-Readers-Edition.pdf){:target="_blank"} : This has been especially useful in speeding up the process of biblical texts. It has definitions and parsings of less common words on each page, as well as a quick reference lexicon of all verb parsings at the end of the book. I've printed out the lexicon as a seperate spiral bound book, and often carry printouts of the smaller epistles with me as I travel for a quick translation exercise.
* [Dr. William Mounce's teaching Overeads](http://ntgreek.org/swc/GreekCO411/mounce.pdf){:target="_blank"} : These are a concise summary of all the important rules and paradigms. I've printed these out and bound them into a spiral book so I can easily reference instead of always having to search through the grammar book.
* [Prinicipal parts of verbs ending in labials](https://www.promotelatin.org/images/stories/pdf/Greek/GREEKCoreverbs-stemlabial.pdf){:target="_blank"} : Helpful for studying the prinicipal parts of verbs; many other similar pdfs on other greek grammar aspects are available [here](https://www.promotelatin.org/images/stories/pdf/Greek/){:target="_blank"}
* [Koine Greek Paradigms](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxpY2hlZ3JlZWt8Z3g6NTNkYmE4MjYxMzFiZjA0ZQ){:target="_blank"} : Nicely arranged printable for easy reference
* [A different look at prepositions](https://www.wikichristian.org/wiki/en/index.php?title=Koine_Greek:_Prepositions&oldid=669404){:target="_blank"} : From wikichristian
* [Irregular verbs](http://pietrociavarella.altervista.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/irregularverbsgnt.pdf){:target="_blank"} : Handy guide
* [Another one on prinicple parts](https://wermuthsgreekbook.files.wordpress.com/2008/08/principal-parts-of-greek-verbs-chart.pdf){:target="_blank"}: Wermuth's greek book
* [Berean Bibles](https://berean.bible/downloads.htm){:target="_blank"} : Free PDF and Word versions of the Berean Greek NT and the Berean Interlinear Bible are available here.
* [Scripture4all Interlinears](https://www.scripture4all.org/OnlineInterlinear/Greek_Index.htm){:target="_blank"} : These interlinears are available as chapter wise downloads and have the parsings included. I frequently print out a few chapters and carry them with me along with a print out of the same chapter in a reader's version above. A great resource, but the only thing is it uses all caps for the greek. I wish it used lower case instead.
* [Nifty greek handouts](https://classics.uchicago.edu/people/helma-dik/nifty-greek-handouts){:target="_blank"} : Some of these are useful to print out and study the various forms

It has a very good learning environment that lets you review words based on their difficulty and your progress. The apps are opensource and available for most operating systems and mobiles. [Ankiweb](https://ankiweb.net/about){:target="_blank"} , which is the companion website, has a readymade set of flashcards based on Dr. Mounce's Basics of Biblical Greek text book. All you need to do is create a free account, log in and search for Mounce and you should be able to find it.
* [Mastergreek parsing practice tool](https://www.mastergreek.com/){:target="_blank"}: It's free and very useful for practicing and retaining all those forms and paradigms in memory, but has ads.
